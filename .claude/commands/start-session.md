## Project Context

@CLAUDE.md

---

## Session Status

Now read all `*-status.md` files in the project root directory and provide a concise summary of:

1. **Current project status** - what phase/stage each workstream is at
2. **What's been completed** - key items finished
3. **Next steps** - prioritised list of available actions

Then ask which next step the user would like to pursue.

Keep the summary brief and actionable.
