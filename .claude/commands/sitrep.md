description: Quick project status check 
---

Read all `*-status.md` files in the project root directory and provide a concise summary of:

1. **Current project status** - what phase/stage each workstream is at
2. **What's been completed** - key items finished
3. **Next steps** - prioritised list of available actions

Then ask which next step the user would like to pursue.

## Important

- **Read status files only** - do NOT automatically read session logs or reference documents
- **Signpost session logs** - if a status file references a session log (e.g., `linkedin-session-logs.md`), mention it exists but don't read it unless the user asks
- **Keep the summary brief and actionable** - status files are designed to be lean (~50 lines each)

## Example signposting

> "LinkedIn has detailed session history in `linkedin-session-logs.md` if you need context on past decisions."

Only read session logs if the user explicitly asks for more context on a specific topic.
